# Tic Tac Toe

A single-player implementation of the popular tic tac toe board game. Written in Python 3.

## Description

This program implements the tic tac toe board game in single-player mode.
A single person can play this game and will be playing against the computer.
The "computer" in this case is a very simple function that chooses a random field on the 
tic tac toe board with the only condition that the field is blank (not filled by a previous
computer or user move).

|How To Play:                                                         |                                                                   |
| - When the game starts, the tic tac toe board is displayed.         |
| - The computer then makes a move.                                   |
| - Once the computer has made its move, you may make your move.      |
| - When that time comes along, choose a number from 1 to 9.          |
| - This number corresponds to the fields on the tic tac toe board,   |
|   which are numbered left to right, top to bottom.                  |
| - To win, get three o's in a row on the tic tac toe board           |
|                                                                     |  
|Example:                                                             |                                                                |
|If a player wanted to choose the field in the upper right-hand       |
|corner of the tic tac toe board, they would choose the number 3.     |
|                                                                     |
|Good luck!                                                           |

## Help

Due to this program's relative simplicity and few external requirements, there should be no issues with the program. 
However, bugs can of course occur in all programs. If the program crashes when using it or a bug is encountered,
please report the bug to me in the form of a GitHub Issue, and I will try to fix the bug or problem as soon as I can.
